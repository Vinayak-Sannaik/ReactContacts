// Add a contact, make a POST call to the above url (from where you are fetching) and save the contact in react state. (This will be a dummy request, you wonâ€™t be able to add contacts to the server. But the request is valid and will send you some data. Read the guide).

// FYI - The Fetch API is a modern interface that allows you to make HTTP requests to servers from web browsers.
